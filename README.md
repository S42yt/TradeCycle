# Features

There are two variants to cycle through trades:

1. **Press F (default)**: Press the button associated with swapping the items to your offhand (**IMPORTANT**: The Cursor
   needs to be in the Inventory due to Minecraft limitations).
2. **Shift Right Click**: Shift right-click on the villager to cycle through trades. However, this variant is disabled
   by default, have a look at our [#Config](#Config) section to enable it.

### 🚨 Note: If a villager has no profession or has been traded with, you cannot cycle through trades.

# Config

You can configure which method (or both) should be used to cycle through trades:

```yaml
strategy:
  - KEYBOARD
# - SHIFT_INTERACT
```

'#' in front of a method will disable it.

The SHIFT_INTERACT was made with bedrock and Geyser in mind so you can also cycle trades on the bedrock edition. But it
doesnt work in UI with this strategy.
